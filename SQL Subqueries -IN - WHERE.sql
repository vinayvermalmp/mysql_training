SQL Subqueries nested in SELECT and FROM - exercise 2
Fill emp_manager with data about employees, the number of the department they are working in, and their managers.

Your query skeleton must be:

Insert INTO emp_manager SELECT

U.*

FROM
                 (A)

UNION (B) UNION (C) UNION (D) AS U;

A and B should be the same subsets used in the last lecture (SQL Subqueries Nested in SELECT and FROM).
 In other words, assign employee number 110022 as a manager to all employees from 10001 to 10020 (this must be subset A), 
 and employee number 110039 as a manager to all employees from 10021 to 10040 (this must be subset B).

Use the structure of subset A to create subset C, where you must assign employee number 110039 as a manager to employee 110022.

Following the same logic, create subset D. Here you must do the opposite - assign employee 110022 as a manager to employee 110039.

Your output must contain 42 rows.

Good luck!
